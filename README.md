# Birch

Birch is a Minecraft log viewer that allows you to easily search chat logs. It is currently in beta, and runs on Windows and Mac.

## Usage

After installing and opening Birch, it should show the chat from your latest log file. If it can't find the file, your Minecraft installation might not be in the default location. This can be changed from the Birch settings. Note that any changes to the settings require restarting Birch.

### Advanced Search

There may be times when it would be useful to search for multiple things. The advanced search has two modes:
- `and`: a message must contain all of the searched words
- `or`: a message can contain any of the searched words

To return to simple search mode, press the search button at the top of the page.
