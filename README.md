## Usage

After installing and opening Birch, it should show the chat from your latest log file. If it can't find the file, your Minecraft installation might not be in the default location. This can be changed from the Birch settings. Note that any changes to the settings require restarting Birch.

### Advanced Search

There may be times when it would be useful to search for multiple things. The advanced search feature lets you create search groups which can be independently configured to filter messages in different ways.

There are two modes:
- `all`: match messages that contain all of the searched words
- `any`: match messages that contain any of the searched words

The search type can be set to `include` or `exclude` to control whether or not the messages need to contain the searched words. This allows you to hide messages that would otherwise appear in the search result.
